# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-07)

**Core value:** A numerically faithful Nord2000 engine — validated against the FORCE road-traffic test cases — that produces correct per-band outdoor sound levels over GIS terrain.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — FORCE Harness, Geometry Model & Direct Path

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (FORCE Harness, Geometry Model & Direct Path)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-07 — Roadmap created for Milestone 1 (validated core engine); 30/30 v1 requirements mapped across 4 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone 1 = validated core engine only (no map/UI/GIS ingestion); geometry fed from FORCE test-case files
- FORCE test harness (VAL-01) lands before any propagation code — Phase 1, plan 01-01
- 1/12-octave complex evaluation designed in from the first propagation phase, not retrofitted; output contract = `H[sub_source, receiver, freq]` complex tensor (Phase 4)
- Numerics guarded from the start: f64 throughout, ξ singularity clamps, cancellation-safe Δτ reformulation (Phase 3)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Must obtain AV 1106/07 and the FORCE road-traffic test-case suite before Phase 1 execution (copyrighted — implement from equations, never redistribute)
- Open question (Phase 3/4): how to represent Nord2000 partial-coherence (coefficient F_τ) alongside the coherent complex transfer — channel/representation decision pending

## Deferred Items
